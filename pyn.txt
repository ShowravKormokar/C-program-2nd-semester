I accidentally open two accounts with the same phone number and National ID card and later used this skshowrav90@gmail.com e-mail in the account I opened, now I want to delete the account opened with this email skshowrav90@gmail.com. Please tell me, how do I delete it?

If you open two accounts with the same phone number and national ID card, will there be any problem?
